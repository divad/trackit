## TODO

# svnautoversion
# decide where the config files should be (trac ldap, authz file, etc.)
# delete repos
# hook in calls to trackitd on all trackitweb functions
# trackitd error checking, exception handling, error method back to caller

# trac admin changes hook in web app

# how to suspend??

# svn hook for email - trackitd will do this
# hooks? (samba) - trackitd will create a samba config file for each repo

# other auth types ("All university members", "public")...MAYBE
# instance usage/quotas
